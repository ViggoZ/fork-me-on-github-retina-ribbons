Fork me on GitHub Retina Ribbons
===

Over four years ago, [Tom Preston‐Werner](https://twitter.com/mojombo) released his iconic [‘Fork me on GitHub’ banners](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons) that we all know and love. I thought I’d update them for high‐resolution displays after adding one to [Tally](http://tally.jit.su) — [the new template engine I’m working on for Node.js and browsers](http://tally.jit.su) — and seeing that it was blurry on my iPad.

I’ve recreated all the original colours (red, green, black, orange, grey, and white) and added a few new ones to boot. I hope you find them useful.

[Find all the banners and copy/paste code snippets on my blog post.](http://aralbalkan.com/scribbles/fork-me-on-github-retina-ribbons/)

PS. I’ve also uploaded the original [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) file so you can customise them to your heart’s desire.

About the various image folders
---

```/images``` These are the images you should use. They’ve been through ImageOptim and [tinypng.org](http://tinypng.org) (lossy compression that maintains the alpha channel). Sample size difference with uncompressed (52kb → 18kb). Overall, the final images are 64% smaller than the original uncompressed exports from Sketch.

```/images-imageoptim``` The images in this folder have only undergone non‐lossy compression.

```/images-uncompressed``` These are the original exports from Sketch.
