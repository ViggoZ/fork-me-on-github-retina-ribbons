Fork me on GitHub Retina Ribbons
===

It’s been over four years since Tom Preston‐Werner released his iconic [‘Fork me on GitHub’ banners](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons) that we all know and love.

When I recently added one to the Tally web site, I saw that it was unacceptably blurry our high‐resolution displays (especially on my iPad) and decided to create a Retina version. So I though, heck, if I’m going to create one for myself, I might as well create a whole bunch so everyone can use them. I recreated all the original colours (red, green, black, orange, grey, and white) and added a few more to boot.

I’ve also uploaded the original [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) file so you can customise them to your heart’s desire.

About the various image folders
---

```/images``` These are the images you should use. They’ve been through ImageOptim and [tinypng.org](http://tinypng.org) (lossy compression that maintains the alpha channel). Sample size difference with uncompressed (52kb → 18kb). Overall, the final images are 64% smaller than the original uncompressed exports from Sketch.

```/images-imageoptim``` The images in this folder have only undergone non‐lossy compression.

```/images-uncompressed``` These are the original exports from Sketch.
